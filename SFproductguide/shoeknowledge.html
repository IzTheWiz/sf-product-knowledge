        <h1>Shoe Component Glossary</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                LAST - A shoe last is a 3-dimensional wooden or plastic mold upon which a shoe is constructed. The last used during shoe assembly can affect the overall fit of a shoe, and all lasts dictates all the following dimensions/shapes: Heel width. Instep height. Forefoot width. (SF only uses plastic lasts)
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>There are different lasts for every different type of shoe. For example, our Perfect Zip Bootie and Natalie are made on different plastic last structures.</p></li>
                <li><p>The last stays with the shoe the entire way through production. There is a hinge in the middle of each last that breaks off and can be pulled out.</p></li>
                <li><p>There is a different last for every single size and this price can add up. That is the reason why we spend so much time in development to make it perfect! Once you get it right, you can build other styles around it.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <span>
                <p>Fun Fact: Our Perfect Pump took two years of development and that's why it's perfect!
                </p>

            <p>ARCH - The curved area of a shoe sole between the ball and the heel, which is sometimes padded to provide extra support. Our arch support helps with any pain that's experienced in the arch.</p>
            <br />
            <p>FOOTBED - The inner part of a shoe that contacts the bottom of a foot. This may also be called the shoe's insole or inner sole.</p>
            <br />
            <p>HEEL COUNTER - A stiff piece of material at the heel of a shoe positioned between the lining and the upper that helps maintain the shape of the shoe. The counter helps strengthen the rear of the sole.</p>
            <br />
            <p>HEEL CAP - A protective piece of metal or plastic found at the bottom of a heel.</p>
            <br />
            <p>OUTSOLE - The exposed part of the sole that is in contact with the ground. As with all parts of the shoe, outsoles are made from a variety of materials. The properties the outsole need are grip, durability, and water resistance.</p>

                *An SF insole has anatomical arch support in the footbed, a traditionally wider toe box, 6mm of memory foam in our perfect styles, and 3mm of memory foam in non-perfect styles!

        <div>
            <p>UPPER - All parts of a shoe above the sole that are stitched together/The bulk of the exterior of the shoe, everything except the sole and interior.</p>
            <br />
            <p>BINDING/PIPING - Binding techniques that is used to enclose the raw edges of light weight and sheer fabrics or leather. SF loves binding.</p>
            <br />
            <p>VAMP - The portion of a shoe's upper covering the front top of the foot.</p>
            <br />
            <p>WELT - The strip of material that unites a shoe's sole to the upper, often made of rubber, plastic, or leather. Ex: On Joy sandal.</p>
            <br />
            <p>SHANK - A piece of metal inserted between the sole and the insole lying against the arch of the foot.</p>
            <br />
            <p>TOPLINE - The top edge of the upper.</p>
            <br />
            <p>TOE BOX - The toe box is the part of a shoe that covers and protects the toes.</p>
            <br />
            <p>TONGUE - A strip of material that is attached to the vamp and runs under the laces of a shoe.</p>
