            Definition:
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Feet are strong and complex mechanical structures containing 26 bones, 33 joints, (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments.</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>The average person walks 110,000 miles in their lifetime.</li>
                </ul>
            Fun Facts:
            <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>They are some of the most impressive parts of our body</li>
                    <br />
                    <li>It's what makes us predators - our feet can mold to terrain and we are able to be barefoot</li>

            <p>
                It's important to remember that all feet come in different shapes and sizes - not one foot is the same!
            </p>
            <h3>3 different types:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Egyptian Feet (which grade down in size evenly at an angle)</li>
                <br />
                <li>Greek Feet (where the second toe is longer than the big toe)</li>
                <br />
                <li>Roman Feet (where most of the toes are all the same length/same length as the big toe)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Egyptian feet are what most lasts are built on and is the standard by which all shoes are made.</h3>

        <h2>Pronation VS Supination</h2>
        <div class="container__pro-vs-sup">
            <p>Everyone has some level of pronation or supination - look at the heel of your pumps.</p>
                <br />
            <p>Pronation - The natural inward rotation of the foot with each step. Pronation is a natural movement of the foot that occurs during foot landing while running or walking.</p>
                <br />
            <p>Supination - Supination (or under-pronation) is the opposite of pronation and refers to the outward roll of the foot during normal motion. 
                A natural amount of supination occurs during the push-off phase of the running gait as the heel lifts off the ground and the forefoot and toes are used to propel the body forward.</p>

            <p>Metatarsal bones - The metatarsal bones are connected to the bones of the toe at the knuckle of the toe, or metatarsophalangeal joint.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If your shoe is too tight, it will cause the metatarsal bones to press together, which causes pain and swelling in your toe box.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Your body weight is distributed as 90% on the heel and 10% on the toes. For every inch higher of pumps that you wear, the distribution will fall more on the toes.</p>
